# What Product Management Does

Drives discovery of the right things to do for customers and the company, and empowers teams to deliver them in the smallest chunks as soon as possible.

Is **outcome** focused, not _output_ focused - but empowers output as a necessity of the outcomes

Ensures everyone **understands** how and why product decisions have been made

Maintains the best possible balance of team investment in customer experience, business, and technology according to the company strategy at the time.

Helps **all experts and leaders** appropriately connect and feel ownership in their part in the product investment and decision process

Facilitates and drives those decisions, and the expectations of their results.

Fosters and leads towards a culture of true continuous improvement for the product, the team members, and the company

In a world where we’re competing against luck, works with the whole team to bend the odds in the company’s favor

## Product Management IS NOT: 

All knowing

A bottleneck or gatekeeper

A taskmaster

A dictator or monarch

## Product Management IS:

Customer focused, but remembers the business and technology

A communicator and connector

Accountable and expects accountability from all individuals whose work is necessary to manage the product

A coach, teacher, and facilitator

## Discovery

“There is a philosophy of product management that says ‘just ask the customers what they want and build it,’ and an opposite ‘faster horses’ philosophy that says ‘I know better than customers what they need.’  The truth is there’s a spectrum there and you need to find your place between those two ends of it.”
