retrospective 2017-11-01 - 2018-02-01

What went well

- I really liked the concept and got good momentum going 
- The experiment helped clarify my approach for presentation to a new group of people
- got into a good rhythm early on

What didn't go well

- my personal website where I wanted to post about the concept is kind of broken for posting purposes and needs to be rebuilt, killing momentum
- new job completely blew up any off time I have so I can get things stabilized, leaving no time for the writing

What I'm going to do next
- put the project on soft pause for another quarter, by which I should be ready to give it a full investment due to being up to speed at work and able to focus on some investment in side projects

- aim for a restart on 2018-05-01
