# A public, evolving catalog of my personal philosophies

One thing I believe is that "writing is thinking." 

I believe that by deliberately writing down the things I believe as I have cause to examine them, I will have a good resource to point to and to use as a base to create other artifacts from.

I do not claim to know everything, but want to have a place to keep myself honest and to use as a repository as I discover and evolve my thinking and positions over time.

As that evolution happens, I can gain the benefits of using the medium of git revision control and pull requests to trace the path of my own thinking in a way I've found useful in other pursuits where I've spent my time.
