# Strong opinions, revision controlled

I’ve often caught myself repeating a word or phrase in every other conversation, and I’ve definitely seen this habit in others. More and more, I’ve been noticing that pattern in myself but supercharged. Instead of just words, I repeat whole, complex thoughts over and over to many of the people I interact with.

I’ve also reviewed older work and recognized a thought that I had repeated often at the time, but not recently. Realizing that the past version of me sometimes had a good point, I end up wondering why I moved away from using that approach to communicate or persuade.

Two of the mottos I’ve adopted are “strong opinions, weakly held” and “writing is thinking.” 

One way of living those two things might be to maintain an ongoing, written record of those opinions and see their evolution as they are expanded, changed, and dropped.

I know from experience how useful revision control can be for working on software, even on a solo project. I’ve often wondered how that style of revision control might be useful when applied to other purposes. But, I haven’t personally seen a great example.

What if I put my opinions, positions, and even beliefs into a git repository?

Git repos, and GitHub hosted ones especially, are transparent and concrete, but changeable. They also support a variety of feedback mechanisms tailored for software, but that might work for something like that too.

I am committing (ha) to conducting an experiment, and to doing it in the open. 

In late 2017, I committed to a 90 window for this experiment - and it didn’t stick. I rationalize that as my website where I wanted to post about this content was not in posting shape. I also started a new job right after that which ate into almost all of my mental energy.

I still am planning to focus on this experiment again, especially since at the time of this writing my [website  ](https://craigsturgis.com)has been resurrected.

I’m looking forward to discovering just how well developed my thoughts are on the topics I feel strongly about over time. I’m also curious about what I say without thinking too hard that might change upon examination.

Lastly, I’m interested to see how something like this is perceived, or if anyone aside from me even cares. A single snapshot could come off as claiming to be an authority on the topics written about, which is not my intent with this project.

An ongoing investment, and the evolution of the repository’s contents over time might reveal to me whether another thing I repeat often rings true: “the more you know, the more you know you don’t know.”`
