# A public, evolving catalog of my personal philosophies

One thing I believe is that "writing is thinking." 

I believe that by deliberately writing down the things I believe as I have cause to examine them, I will have a good resource to point to and to use as a base to create other artifacts from.

As my thinking evolves, I can gain the benefits of using the medium of git to trace the path of my own thinking in a way I've found useful in other pursuits where I've spent my time.
