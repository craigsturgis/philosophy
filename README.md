# A public, evolving catalog of my personal philosophies

One thing I believe is that "writing is thinking." 

I believe that by deliberately writing down the things I believe as I have cause to examine them, and update them over time as my thinking evolves, I will not only have a good resource to point people to and to create other artifacts from, but that by using git as a medium, I will have a record of how it has changed over time.
