# Core Values

## Be Thoughtful.

Regularly take time and mental energy to reflect and consider your actions. Consider their impact on you, and the people you interact with every day as well as broader groups and societies as a whole. Consider what you want your actions to be, the life you want to live, and world you want to live in.

## Be Deliberate.

Your mind wants to put what you do on auto-pilot. Take your conclusions from being thoughtful and work to adjust systems and habits for yourself and nudge those around you towards a better place. Acknowledge that entropy and habit and everyoneâ€™s monkey brains and biases including yours are always working to knock it all back to where things are on auto-pilot.

## Be Effective.

You have a tendency to work to be efficient, but it can sometimes lead to more energy spent doing things that are urgent but not important. Use your thoughtfulness and deliberateness to make sure you are making the most progress as realistically possible towards the end state you imagined using the habits and systems you are deliberately following.

## Be Principled

Have strong opinions, weakly held. Develop them over time into principles that you can use and evolve. Firmness of principle is only of value if heavily and deliberately considered in light of new information and experience.

## Be Kind

Your default demeanor can sometimes be short and forceful. Focus on counteracting that to be kind in small acts and in larger affect. You aspire to become known more for kindness vs. the intensity that can come with having heavily considered principles, without being a pushover.
