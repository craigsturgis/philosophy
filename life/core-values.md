# Core Values

When I think of core values, I think about the articulated ideas that explain how people live their life, and show what they aspire to. These are mine. 

## Every day is a great day.

We only get so many days, and it’s tempting to live for some imagined future when things will be great. 

I can’t control everything that happens to and around me, but I can control my mindset, reaction, and whether I do my best to make each day a great one for myself and others. 

## Build and be open to love and trust.

Days can only be so great without the love and shared experience of people outside of yourself. I want to do my best to make a conscious effort to build in my life both love and the trust that makes all relationships stronger.

At the same time, I want to do my best to be more open to receive the love and trust in return, even though this is has been harder for me than giving it in the past.

## Always be learning,  applying, and sharing. Form strong opinions, loosely held.

The primary intrinsic motivation I have is to learn.

I want to do my best to always be feeding that thirst for knowledge, applying the results, and sharing them with others. 

I support strong opinions, loosely held: having a point of view that is clear and direct, but I do my best to be humble and open to learning from others with conflicting opinions. 

I especially try to be open to those with different backgrounds and experiences to make sure I’m learning as much as I can and staying aware of biases I may not ever be able to fully offset.

## Be thoughtful, intentional, effective, and kind

I do my best to regularly take time and energy to reflect and consider my actions and their impact. I try to work to know myself and the landscape I inhabit.

I do my best to plan specifically how I want to act and then create systems and habits to support those actions. I try to fight going through life on “auto-pilot”, knowing that my monkey brain is fighting back to put me there at all times.

I do by best to gauge whether my actions are having the desired impact and outcome vs. just optimizing for what feels good or efficient.

Through it all, I try to work to be kind to others - my default demeanor can sometimes be intense, short, and forceful. I do my best to work to counteract that and to be kind in small acts and in larger effect.

## Act in good faith

I do my best to take action in ways that openly reflect my core beliefs and values - hiding them can be an easier path to the results I want but in a way that I believe would be hollow and unsatisfying.

The world is full of people who act in bad faith, but the world I want to live in is one in which that is acknowledged but good faith is supported and rewarded anyway. I try to walk the path I want others to walk.
