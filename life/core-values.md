# Core Values

When I think of core values, I think about the articulated ideas that explain how people live their life, and show what they aspire to. These are mine. 

## Every day is a great day.

We only get so many days, and it’s easy to live for some imagined future when things will be great. 

You don’t control everything that happens to and around you, but you do control your mindset, reaction, and whether you do your best to make each day a great one for yourself and others. 

## Build and be open to love and trust.

Days can only be so great without the love and shared experience of people outside of yourself. Make a conscious effort to build love and the trust that makes all relationships stronger.

In addition, work to be more open to receive the love and trust you cultivate, even though this is often harder for you than giving it.

## Always be learning,  applying, and sharing. Form strong opinions, loosely held.

The primary intrinsic motivation you have is to learn, and apply that learning. 

Always remember to feed that thirst for knowledge, apply the results, and share it with others. 

Support strong opinions, loosely held: have a point of view that is unreserved but be humble and open to learning from others with conflicting opinions. 

Be especially open to those with different backgrounds and experiences to make sure you’re learning as much as you can and stay aware of biases you can’t ever completely offset.

## Be thoughtful, intentional, effective, and kind

Regularly take time and energy to reflect and consider your actions and their impact. Work to know yourself and the landscape you inhabit.

Plan specifically how you want to act and create systems and habits to support those actions. Fight going through life on “auto-pilot”, knowing that your monkey brain is fighting to put you there at all times.

Always gauge whether your actions are having the desired impact and outcome vs. just optimizing for what feels efficient.

Through it all, work to be kind to others - your default demeanor can sometimes be intense, short, and forceful. Work to counteract that and to be kind in small acts and in larger effect.

## Act in good faith

Take action in ways that openly reflect your core beliefs and values - hiding them can be an easier path to the results you want but in a way that is hollow and unsatisfying. 

The world is full of people who act in bad faith, but the world you want to live in is one in which that is acknowledged but good faith is supported and rewarded anyway.
