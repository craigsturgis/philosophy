# Core Values

## Be Thoughtful.

Regularly take time and mental energy to reflect and consider your actions. 
Consider their impact on you, and the people you interact with every day as well as broader groups and societies as a whole. 

Consider what perspectives you can’t understand due to who you are. 

Develop explicit principles and strong opinions, weakly held. 

Consider what you want your actions to be in light of this, the life you want to live, and world you want to live in.

## Be Deliberate.

Your mind wants to put what you do on auto-pilot. 

Take your conclusions from being thoughtful and work to adjust systems and habits for yourself and nudge those around you towards a better place. 

Work to incorporate the experience and empower the expertise of others different from you to complement what you can do.

Acknowledge that entropy and habit and everyone’s monkey brains and biases, including yours, are always working to knock it all back to where things are on auto-pilot. Work to counteract this.


## Be Effective.

You have a tendency to work to be efficient, but it can sometimes lead to more energy spent doing things that are urgent but not important. 

Use your thoughtfulness and deliberateness to make sure you are making the most progress as realistically possible towards the end state you imagined using the habits and systems you are deliberately following.

## Be Kind

Your default demeanor can sometimes be short and forceful. 

Focus on counteracting that to be kind in small acts and in larger affect. 

You aspire to become known more for kindness vs. the intensity and rigidness that can come with having heavily considered principles.
