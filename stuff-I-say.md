# Stuff I say often to mine for more elaboration

“Writing is thinking”

“Strong opinions, weakly held”

“We’re living in a society”

“Product management is communication”

“A well executing team is necessary but not sufficient to be successful”

“Software development has changed dramatically in the last 5-15 years. Product Management has changed even more dramatically.”

“In this world, nothing is obvious”

“Think about the principles not just the process”

“There is no one right way to do this”

“What are the next actions? Who’s going to take what?”

“Can we ladder this up?”

“What are customers hiring us to do?”

“Can we take this discussion up a level?”

“Let’s be direct and clear here.”

“Let’s be thoughtful and deliberate about this.”

“Lowercase a - agile”

“On a relatively short timeline, all companies will be technology companies”

“I love you and I like you”

“The intersection of inside out and outside in thinking”

“There is a philosophy of product management that says ‘just ask the customers what they want and build it,’ and an opposite ‘faster horses’ philosophy that says ‘I know better than customers what they need.’  The truth is there’s a spectrum there and you need to find your place between those two ends of it.”
